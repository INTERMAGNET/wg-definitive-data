### Summary  
The meeting transcript from February 27, 2026, focuses on the ongoing discussion regarding the publication and citation strategy for definitive geomagnetic data products within the Intermagnet consortium. Historically, definitive data products were published annually on CDs and later online, each with unique Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs). The current debate centers on moving towards a simplified system employing a single DOI (or Digital Unique Identifier, DUI) that covers a growing, dynamic repository of definitive data rather than issuing new DOIs annually.  

The participants, including Roman Leonhardt, Kirsten Elger, Jan Reda, Simon Flower, Marcos Vinicius da Silva, and Jürgen Matzka, explore the technical, organizational, and user-experience implications of this shift. Key challenges discussed include how to handle data corrections and updates, maintain reproducibility and citation accuracy, and avoid confusing users with multiple versions or releases. The group weighs the pros and cons of having one continuously updated DOI with versioning (release identifiers) versus maintaining annual DOIs that freeze data snapshots for citation purposes.

Kirsten emphasizes the importance of intuitive user access and the need to keep previous versions accessible for reproducibility, while avoiding overwhelming users with complex archives. There is consensus on the necessity for a detailed changelog and metadata management to track data additions and corrections. The group also discusses the file structure and format challenges, particularly regarding zipped files containing observatory data, and the scalability of manual updates.

Several interim solutions are proposed, including maintaining the current structure temporarily while enabling more frequent data additions, and preparing for a future, broader restructuring of the data archive and DOI system. The meeting concludes with agreement to proceed with publishing a new definitive data set for 2025 under the existing structure, allowing incremental additions and corrections, while postponing decisions on a single DOI system and file structure overhaul to the next Intermagnet meeting. Further collaboration and technical adjustments are planned to improve metadata and user documentation, ensuring clarity and usability.

### Key Insights  
- 📌 **Balancing Data Currency with Stability:** The main tension lies between providing users with the most up-to-date data quickly (via a continuously growing repository and single DOI) and preserving fixed, stable snapshots for reproducibility and citation (via annual DOIs). This reflects a classic versioning dilemma in scientific data management, where immediacy must be weighed against traceability. The group’s recognition of this problem and exploration of release identifiers as a middle ground shows maturity in data governance.  

- 🔍 **User Experience Complexity:** The discussion highlights that users often find multiple versions and numerous DOIs confusing, which can lead to misuse or mis-citation of data. Kirsten’s point about users preferring a simple, intuitive way to access the “latest” data while still having access to previous versions underscores the importance of carefully designed interface and metadata strategies. This is fundamental in scientific data services, where ease of use directly impacts data adoption and integrity.  

- 🛠️ **Technical Constraints Limit Ideal Solutions:** The reliance on zipped files containing multiple observatory data complicates incremental updates and version control. Since zipped files are monolithic, any addition or correction results in a new file version, challenging DOI granularity and changelog precision. This suggests that a more modular data structure might be necessary long-term, but transitioning to this requires careful planning to avoid disruption.  

- 🗃️ **Scalability and Manual Effort:** The current system depends heavily on manual updates by a few key personnel, which is not scalable if data submissions become more frequent or numerous. This bottleneck could delay data availability and increase error risk. Future automation or distributed data management responsibilities may be required to maintain timely and reliable data publication.  

- 📑 **Importance of Metadata and Documentation:** Clear, comprehensive metadata including changelogs, version identifiers, observatory details, and update histories is critical to maintain trust, reproducibility, and usability. The group’s plan to improve metadata and abstracts accompanying DOIs is a step towards transparency and user empowerment. This also supports citation accuracy and long-term scientific credibility.  

- 🤝 **Collaboration and Governance:** The discussions reveal the importance of multi-stakeholder coordination (data providers, IT staff, data managers, and users) to create feasible workflows. The plan to continue discussions in broader Intermagnet meetings and smaller working sessions shows an understanding that data publication strategy must balance technical feasibility, user needs, and governance frameworks.  

- 🚀 **Incremental Implementation Over Radical Change:** Rather than implementing a radical overhaul immediately, the group opts for incremental improvements—publishing the 2025 dataset promptly with the existing structure while preparing for a more comprehensive future restructuring. This pragmatic approach reduces risk, maintains continuity, and builds user confidence as new workflows and technologies are phased in.  

### Summary of the Main Discussion Points and Conclusions  
- **Single DOI vs. Multiple DOIs:** The central question is whether to adopt a single, continuously updated DOI that reflects a growing dataset or maintain annual DOIs representing frozen releases. The single DOI model offers speed and simplicity but requires careful versioning and user guidance. Annual DOIs provide stability and clarity but delay data availability.  

- **Change Tracking:** To support reproducibility, all changes and corrections must be archived and accessible. This requires a changelog and metadata that clearly annotate when and what changed, and which version was used in a publication.  

- **File Structure Challenges:** Current zipped data files are not ideal for incremental updates. Proposed alternatives include breaking data into smaller zip files per observatory or reorganizing the file hierarchy with “obsolete” or “replaced” folders to separate current from superseded data. However, these changes impact existing software compatibility and require further technical discussion.  

- **User Interface and Access:** Emphasis on designing a user-friendly download and citation mechanism that highlights the latest data while allowing access to prior versions. Folder structures, landing pages, and metadata must support this balance.  

- **Interim Solution:** Publish the 2025 definitive data as soon as possible using the existing system, allowing multiple zip files per year to accommodate incremental data additions. This ensures data availability without waiting for perfect system redesign.  

- **Future Steps:** Further discussions and decisions on data structure, DOI strategy, and technical workflows are deferred to upcoming Intermagnet meetings. Meanwhile, improved metadata management and documentation will aid users.  

- **Governance and Coordination:** Clear communication among data providers, curators, and IT teams is essential for smooth implementation. Manual processes currently dominate but may require automation or distributed responsibility as data volume grows.  

This meeting represents an important step in modernizing geomagnetic data publication practices, balancing the demands of scientific rigor, user convenience, and operational feasibility.
